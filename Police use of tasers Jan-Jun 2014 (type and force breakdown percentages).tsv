Care should be taken when making comparisons between forces on the level of Taser use. This is due to the varying data quality across the forces and that the level of Taser use it likely to be highly correlated with the size of the population in the force area. Forces will also have different policies regarding Taser use.											
There are a number of factors that may lead to an increase or a decrease in the use of Taser. These figures should not be used to interpret how any single factor is changing, for example, the level of crime.
